        <p class="graph-method-description">This is the score per measurement graph (num. of standard deviations from the mean). I calculated the standard deviation and mean for each measurement, and then found the number of standard deviations from the mean for each country, taking these as scores. In the case of non-normal distributions, I applied log transformations for every data point. In the case where lower scores were desirable (such as in taxes), I inverted the sign. </p>

                A credit rating measures the ability of a country or entity to repay debt, assigned by agencies like Moody’s, S&P, or Fitch. Ratings range from high-grade investment ratings (e.g., AAA, A1) indicating low risk, to speculative or junk ratings (e.g., B, C) signaling high risk and potential default. A1 is a high-grade rating, reflecting strong financial stability, but external factors like economic shifts or geopolitical risks can still impact performance.<br><br>
                The equity risk premium (ERP) is the extra return investors expect from stocks compared to risk-free assets like government bonds. For example, an ERP of 5.63% suggests equities are perceived as moderately risky, offering higher potential returns to compensate for volatility and uncertainty. A higher ERP indicates greater risk, while a lower ERP reflects market confidence.
